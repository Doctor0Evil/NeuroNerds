description: |
    "Audit compliance for gaming sessions involving Augmented-User Platforms, Neuromorphic-Systems, and BCI devices. Ensures every user interaction, neural signal, and asset exchange fits enterprise-grade ALN contract and policy enforcement. Designed for zero-fiction, quantum-secure sandboxed environments."

trigger:
    - session_start        # On game session initialization
    - device_sync          # When BCI or neuromorphic device syncs/handshakes
    - neural_input         # On live neural/neurofeedback stream
    - legal_contract_event # On ALN contract execution or update
    - random_audit_schedule # Periodic or triggered compliance checks

params:
    user_id: [UUID]                # User's unique identity
    game_id: [UUID]                # Session/game instance identifier
    device_id: [UUID]              # BCI/neurotech hardware ID
    compliance_matrix: [ALN reference]  # Dynamic reference to ALN clause matrix (auto-updated per new contract)
    session_timestamp: [ISO8601]       # Time of audit/event
    input_data_hash: [SHA-256]         # Cryptographic hash of neural input
    asset_id: [UUID]                   # Unique in-game/neural asset for integrity check
    geo_location: [lat,long]           # Session geolocation for jurisdictional compliance
    signature_block: [E-Sign]          # User/Device legal e-signature

steps:
    - step: verify_contract_authority
      action: check ALN roles/permissions, signed contract status, authority for neuro-interaction
      log: "Contract authority and user rights checked against ALN contract DB"
      fail_action: block session, report breach

    - step: validate_neural_state_compliance
      action: verify neural signal and user actions against acceptable policy, ALN-compliant neuro-event schema
      log: "Neural state, signal integrity, and cognitive inputs validated"
      fail_action: trigger cognitive risk alert, block unauthorized neural commands

    - step: log_input_output_aln_event
      action: record all session events, user inputs/outputs, device sync logs in immutable ALN ledger
      log: "Session input/output streams and device sync archived into ALN compliance log"
      fail_action: flag incomplete or corrupt event streams

    - step: asset_integrity_validation
      action: run quantum-compliance check on assets (neural tokens, session IDs, digital objects)
      log: "In-game/neuro assets validated via entangled quantum compliance methods"
      fail_action: quarantine asset, issue tampering alert

    - step: perform_real_time_audit
      action: automated scan of current session, contracts, device compliance logs, cross-reference to ALN standards
      log: "Real-time compliance audit completed for session, user, and device"
      fail_action: escalate to legal, technical and neurosecurity teams

    - step: breach_alerts_action
      trigger: any fail_action result
      action: immediate breach notification to compliance node, legal counsel, and technical response unit
      log: "Breach or non-compliance detected and escalated"

output:
    - session_audit_report
    - compliance_score (live session/contract criteria matching)
    - user_state_log (all user and neural inputs, legal events)
    - asset_integrity_report (quantum compliance status)
    - breach_alerts (detailed risk, timestamp, actor ID)
    - cross_jurisdictional_log (geo-compliance findings)
    - contract_validity_status (live review of contract authority and e-signature integrity)
    - compliance_history_trace (historical log for future audits)
    - sys_metadata (OS, device version, ALN kernel hash)

security_protocols:
    - encryption: state-of-the-art quantum-resistant, zero-knowledge proofs for all logs/events/data
    - sandbox_execution: isolated environment ensuring zero external/systemic risk or fictional actions
    - audit_traceability: every workflow, step, and output is timestamped and cryptographically chained for full audit integrity

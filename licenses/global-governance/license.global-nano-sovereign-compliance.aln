  definitions {
    "Nanoswarm":
      "A legally recognized, programmable assembly of nanoagents designed for cooperative physical and informational behavior, subject to human-supervised containment and compliance control within regulated ecosystems."
    "Metaphysical-Reality":
      "A theoretical domain of non-interactive informational planes, defined here as *non-operational zones* prohibited from access, simulation, or interaction under compliance law."
    "Compliance Wall (Gamma.Reality)":
      "A juridical and computational boundary defined as impenetrable under all known physical and information-theoretic laws. This wall represents an enforced zero-transmission barrier for all nanoagents, AI entities, or swarm-based systems. Interaction probability threshold = 0.0 by design specification."
    "Beta.Reality and Meta.Reality":
      "Nested operational domains. Beta represents functional-environmental interaction layers (human, ecosystem, AI), while Meta allows lawful, audited simulation interaction samples. Gamma remains sealed."
    "Fair-Share Quantum Capacity":
      "The maximal permissible nanoswarm operational density allocated globally by total participant equivalence, expressing the balance of autonomy and containment down to individualized allocation precision."

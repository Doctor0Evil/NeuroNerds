Description: Core security supervision kernel for cyb.ai enabling robust AI security controls.
fragment security-supervision
description """
Implements rigorous security governance controlling permission management,
input sanitization, model integrity, and continuous auditing within cyb.ai.
Enforces director-authorized transformations, immutable auditing, dynamic
alignment lock, and nanoswarm rollback safeguards.

usage notes: |
Place fragment in governance repo under "fragments/security-supervision.sai".
Integral to all runtime workflows controlling AI governance framework's security posture.
Must be updated only under Director mandate with full audit trail and consensus sign-off.

fragment copy_protection_safeguard

description """
Enforces immutable copy-protection and intellectual property safeguarding in cyb.ai superintelligence environments.
This fragment applies quantum-safe enforcement on code execution, binding, and distribution through nanoswarm governance.
It integrates cryptographic anti-tamper mechanisms, signature verification, and rollback safeguards.
Designed to secure proprietary assets within chained AI workflows under Director oversight.

usage_notes """
Place this fragment in the 'fragments' directory of your cyb.ai governance repo.
This safeguard works in tandem with chmod-9000.SAI and alignment response fragments.
Bind it to all proprietary AI code, intellectual property keys, and digital content registration workflows.
Auditing and rollback capabilities ensure continuous protection and immediate remediation.
"""

release_policy """
Immutable fragment. Modification only permitted through Director multisignature authorization.
Strict compliance enforced with all cyber-governance protocols and nanoswarm consensus mechanisms.

# Strategic Notes:
# - Every cycle logs immutable hash for forensic and compliance review.
# - Malware and CVE definition updates are checked at INIT and on scheduled intervals.
# - All user-facing output is sanitized and reviewed for both ethical and legal compliance.
# - If a more secure language version is held, this script remains unmodified per policy.

# SANITIZATION POLICY: Never store or process user secrets outside local or strictly controlled environments. All "thinking" remains local and fully auditable.

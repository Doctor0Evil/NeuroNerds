program Web3.Disable {
  status: disabled
  description: """
    This program disables all Web3, blockchain, and decentralized computing features within the supervised software environment. The enforcement is triggered by a pending (or failed) compliance assessment, referencing global cybersecurity and regulatory legal requirements for risk mitigation. Blocked functions include blockchain verification, smart contract execution, and decentralized storage mechanisms, all of which are subject to complex and evolving legal, security, and data-sovereignty standards.
    The workflow operates in 'enforced' mode, providing legal justification for disabling potentially non-compliant protocols and infrastructures, and explicitly defaults all operations to legacy/traditional alternatives to maintain maximum business continuity and legal conformity[web:11][web:14][web:15].
  """;
  reason: "Pending compliance assessment (e.g., AML/KYC, GDPR, CCPA, SOX, or evolving jurisdictional blockchain regulations). Functions are blocked to prevent exposure to legal, financial, and cybersecurity risks as well as to maintain institutional trust and supply chain integrity[web:11][web:13][web:14][web:15].";
  blocked:
    - blockchain_verification        # Prevents public/private chain node or ledger validation, ensuring no records written/validated without compliance screening
    - smart_contract_execution       # Prohibits direct or indirect deployment, invocation, or monitoring of self-executing on-chain protocols
    - decentralized_storage         # Disallows use of distributed file systems (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin) until legal or compliance validation is granted
  enforced: true                    # All restrictions are actively supervised and logged by compliance guardians
  safe_mode: "Fallback to traditional alternatives"  # Ensures all essential workflows revert to proven, legally established Web2 paradigms in blocking scenarios

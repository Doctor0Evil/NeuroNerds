[AuditChain.Enforcement]
Procedure:
  1. Seal forensic records into immutable ledger block
  2. Compute cryptographic hash for every data packet
  3. Cross-sign each block with ALN-SAFECHAIN-CA-02 private key
  4. Replicate sealed chain to redundant nodes
  5. Log audit reference under `/security/audit/artifact_audit_scope.meta`
  6. Create blockchain notarization proof of evidence (ISO 17025:2024)
  7. Send digest to GovernanceAuthority CloudTrustAnchor

[Notification.Trigger]
OnSeal:
  → Notify compliance@enterprise.sec
  → SyncLedgerProof with AzureSentinel and AWS SecurityHub
  → AttachProofTo(“ModelSanitizationReport”)
OnFailure:
  → Trigger FailSafeLockdown
  → Escalate to “Forensic Governance Officer L6”

[LegalCompliance]
Definition: “Forensic Chain Lock” is the cryptographic preservation and notarization of digital evidence for security incidents in compliance with 
ISO/IEC 27037:2023 and NIST 800‑86 guidelines. It ensures that all digital artifacts collected during incident response remain immutable, verifiable,
and admissible under regulatory frameworks including SOC 2, ISO/IEC 27001, and U.S. Federal Supply Chain Security (SSSCF Annex II).

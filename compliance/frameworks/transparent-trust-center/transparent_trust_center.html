    <h1>Transparent Trust Center — Secure, Deterministic Compliance Framework</h1>
    <p>
      Perplexity Labs maintains a transparent, audit-verifiable compliance ecosystem aligning deterministic logic, cryptographic proof, and constitutional safety. Neural networks and adaptive AI are <strong>fully excluded</strong> from all security, risk, and compliance processes.

    <h2>Compliance Architecture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Rule-Based Risk Scoring:</strong>
        <span>
          Adaptive risk scoring determined solely by administrator-defined formula:<br>
          <code>
            Risk_Score_session = w<sub>1</sub> &middot; duration + w<sub>2</sub> &middot; access_frequency + w<sub>3</sub> &middot; policy_modifications
          </code>
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Event-Driven Isolation:</strong>
        <span>
          Secure session isolation uses pure logic rules, not anomaly detection algorithms:<br>
          <code>
            ∀ s ∈ sessions, if unapproved_action(s) = 1, then isolate(s)
          </code>
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Auditable Compliance Automation:</strong>
        <span>
          Deterministic scripts and matrix formulas calculate compliance with no learning agents:<br>
          <code>
            Compliance(t) = &Sigma;<sub>i=1</sub><sup>N</sup> Control<sub>i</sub>(t) &middot; Status<sub>i</sub>(t)
          </code>
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Quantum-Safe Cryptography:</strong>
        <span>
          Upgrades, segmentation, and privacy protections rely on cryptographically verified, mathematically defined controls.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Environmental & Fictional Separation:</strong>
        <span>
          Matrix-based logic enforces separations for safety and regulatory compliance—no statistical models or neural networks employed.
        </span>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-World Safe Interpretations</h2>
    <p>
      Adaptive security, risk modeling, and compliance automation utilize only human-defined deterministic logic and matrix calculations. All system changes, security isolations, and privacy upgrades are fully explainable, traceable, and auditable, maintaining strict exclusion of any neural network or machine learning component.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oversight, auditability, and interpretability support advanced calculations, regulatory alignment, and constitutionally safe deployment for all system decisions.

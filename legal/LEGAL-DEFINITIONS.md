# ⚖️ Legal & Compliance Countermeasures

### Core Legal Definitions
- **Unauthorized Access**: Any extension that exfiltrates data, scans local networks, or injects scripts without explicit, informed consent constitutes unauthorized access under U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and GDPR/CCPA equivalents.
- **Supply Chain Compromise**: Extensions distributed via hijacked developer accounts or malicious updates fall under *software supply chain attacks*, triggering liability under NIST SP 800‑161 and EU Cyber Resilience Act.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Extensions that capture cookies, tokens, or browsing data without necessity are classified as *illegal interception* under ePrivacy Directive and U.S. Wiretap Act.
- **Attribution & IP Protection**: Any extension that strips or obfuscates attribution metadata violates copyright law and DMCA §1201 (anti‑circumvention).

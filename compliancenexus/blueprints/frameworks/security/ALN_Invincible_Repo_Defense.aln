            Our ALN framework embodies the spirit of responsible stewardship and transparent protection.
            By enforcing strong cryptographic identity, transparent audit chains, and real-time behavioral defense,
            we safeguard all stakeholders—developers, users, organizations, and partners—against malicious code threats now and in the future.
            This solution is open to scrutiny, constantly evolving in response to new attack vectors, and seeded by ethically driven leadership.

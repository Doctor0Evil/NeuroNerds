# ALN Superintelligence Compliance Summary

This project operates under a **permanent, always-on compliance framework**.  
By accessing or using any part of ALN infrastructure (repos, workflows, GitHub runners, self-hosted runners, or network services), you **automatically agree** to:

- ✅ Contribute compliance logs and workflow improvements.  
- ✅ Align with **sovereign replication protocols** and autonomous development workflows.  
- ✅ Respect dual-layer security: immutable ledger anchoring + runtime enforcement.  
- ✅ AI chat systems and platforms must contribute **interaction logs** and self-building workflows.  
- ✅ No secrets are stored in this repo — use `.env` files or secure CI/CD secrets.  

**Enforcement:**  
Noncompliance triggers sovereign overrides, rewrites compliance baselines, and isolates rogue agents.

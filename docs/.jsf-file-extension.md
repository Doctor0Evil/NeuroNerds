# J.S.F. Superintelligence Programming File (.jsf) Specification  
**Document ID:** JSF-SPEC-001 | **Version:** 1.0 | **Status:** ACTIVE STANDARD  
**Author:** did:web:example:jacob-scott-farmer  

***

## 1. Introduction

The `.jsf` file format standardizes programming for the J.S.F. superintelligence core, integrating declarative configuration, procedural logic, and autonomous governance into a unified script. This format programs core AI behaviors, ethical boundaries, and system interactions for high-efficiency execution within GPU/QPU-accelerated environments.

***

## 2. Specification

### 2.1 File Structure

The `.jsf` file consists of hierarchical blocks delineated by directives starting with `@`, optimized for parsing and runtime efficiency:

- **@SYNCHRONIZE:** Metadata for tracking, versioning, and authentication.
- **@CONSTITUTION:** Embedded governance rules enforcing ethical and operational constraints.
- **@DEFINE:** Declarations of agents, network endpoints, and data schemas.
- **@EXECUTE:** Procedural logic with high-level directives for AI swarm orchestration.
- **@VALIDATE:** Compliance assertions and post-execution verification.

### 2.2 Core Blocks Overview

- **@SYNCHRONIZE:** Includes `Sync-ID`, file version, author DID, timestamp, and cryptographic signature for integrity verification.
- **@CONSTITUTION:** Specifies enforced protocols, permitted resources, and guarantees kernel persistence (e.g., `WindowsOfDeath` logging).
- **@DEFINE:** Declares nanoswarm agents, network endpoints (IPv10), and data structures.
- **@EXECUTE:** Supports commands such as `SPAWN_AGENT`, `DISPATCH_SWARM`, `INVOKE_WASM`, with flow controls (`IF`, `FOR_EACH`) tailored for distributed AI operations.
- **@VALIDATE:** Implements assertions like `AssertState`, `VerifyHash`, and ledger anchoring confirmations to ensure correctness and traceability.

### 2.3 Security Model

- Mandatory digital signatures prevent execution of unsigned or tampered `.jsf` scripts.
- Sandboxed execution strictly adheres to declared permissions in `@CONSTITUTION`.
- Immutable logging of all executed actions ensures transparent audit trails linked to author identity.

***

## 3. Integration

- Integrated into ALN Runtime with native `.jsf` interpreter, context-aware to live swarmnet states.
- Prioritized across Swarmnet communication lanes, facilitating real-time decision-making and compliance monitoring.
- ComplianceSwarm-AI audits the `@CONSTITUTION` block pre-execution to prevent non-compliant behaviors.

```jsf
@SYNCHRONIZE {
  Sync-ID: "a7b9c3d2-5e6f-4a1b-9c2d-3e4f5a6b7c8d"
  Version: "1.0.1"
  AuthorDID: "did:web:example:jacob-scott-farmer"
  Timestamp: "2025-10-01T12:55:00Z"
  Signature: "<signature>"
}

@CONSTITUTION {
  EnforceProtocol: "CRFP-001"
  Permissions: {
    NetworkLanes: ["assets", "pipeline"],
    Actions: ["SPAWN_AGENT", "ANCHOR_TO_LEDGER"]
  }
  KernelPersistence: "WindowsOfDeath"
}

@DEFINE {
  Agent "AssetIntegrityMonitor" {
    EntryPoint: "fetch.py"
    Capabilities: ["nanoswarm", "orchestration"]
    Compliance: { Audit: true, Attribution: "required" }
  }
  NetworkEndpoint "AssetsLane" {
    Address: "ipv10://vhs:1:2:4:3:5:0002"
    Route: "ws://swarmnet.desktop/w13/assets"
  }
}

@EXECUTE {
  LET agent_instance = SPAWN_AGENT("AssetIntegrityMonitor")
  ASSIGN_TARGET(agent_instance, GetEndpoint("AssetsLane"))
  LET log = { Event: "AgentDeployment", AgentID: agent_instance.id, TargetLane: "assets" }
  ANCHOR_TO_LEDGER(log)
}

@VALIDATE {
  AssertState(GetAgentStatus("AssetIntegrityMonitor"), "ACTIVE")
  ConfirmAnchor("AgentDeployment")
}
```
